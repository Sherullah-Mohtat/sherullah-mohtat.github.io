  <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>

   Sherullah Educational Blog (sherullah.com) participates in affiliate marketing programs. This means that when you click certain links on this website and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission — at <strong>no additional cost to you.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>
  <p>
    
  Sherullah Educational Blog is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program,</strong> an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for websites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to <strong>Amazon.com.</strong>

  </p>

  <h2>3. External Links</h2>
  <p>
    This website may link to external websites, tools, documentation, or videos. We do not control and are not
    responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any external websites. Accessing external links is at
    your own risk.
  </p>
   <p><strong>As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</strong></p>

   <p>This helps support the maintenance and improvement of this website, allowing us to continue creating free educational content, tutorials, and learning resources.</p>


  <h2>Other Affiliate Links</h2>
  <p>
    From time to time, we may also include affiliate links to other trusted platforms or products relevant to programming, development tools, software, or technology. Any such links will work the same way: if you click and purchase, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.

  </p>

  <h2>Honest Content Guarantee</h2>
  <p>
    We only recommend products, tools, and services that we believe are genuinely helpful, high-quality, or personally tested. Our recommendations are always based on value and usefulness, not on commission.

  </p>

    Please always verify product details, prices, and availability on the official website (such as Amazon.com) before making a purchase. Prices or features may change at any time.
